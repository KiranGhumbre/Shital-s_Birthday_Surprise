            "I'm Shital – born on the 10th of October, with a rough expression
            that keeps people on their knees. I might come off as rude, but deep
            down, I've got a soft spot... somewhere in there! In my imagination,
            I'm undefeated – dishing out some serious smackdowns and pulling my
            friend's hair just for fun. My childhood was all about
            marbles(Gotya) – I ruled the village marble market(Goti Market) like a boss. You could
            say I was a big-time trader before I even hit middle school. Oh, and
            my friend Kiran? He’s basically a mosquito to me, buzzing around, and I
            just can't resist the urge to swat him... affectionately, of
            course!"
